# Arithmatic Operators

# a = int(input("Enter number 1: "))
# b = int(input("Enter number 2: "))
# print(a+b)
# print(a-b)
# print(a*b)
# print(a/b)
# print(a//b)
# print(a%b)
# print(a**b)

# Assignment Operators

# a = eval(input("Enter the number: "))
# for i in range(5):
#     a += i
#     print(a)

# Logical Operators

# a = True
# b = False
# print(a and b)
# print(a or b)
# print(not a)
# print(not b)

# Bitwise Operators

# a = 16
# print(a>>1)
# print(a>>2)

# print(a<<1)
# print(a<<2)

# x = 3
# y = 5
# print(x&y)
# print(x|y)
# print(x^y)
# print(~x)

# Ternary Operator

# a = 5
# b = 30
# ans = "A is greater then B" if a>b else "A is less than B"
# print(ans)

# print(("A is not equal to B", "A is equal to B") [a==b])

# Membership Operator

# a = ["Simran", "Aditi", "Kritika"]
# print("Bedika" in a) 
# print("Bedika" not in a)

# Identity Operator

a = 10
b = 15
c = 10
print(id(a))
print(id(b))
print(id(c))

print(a is c)
print(a is b)
